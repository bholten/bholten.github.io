Those of you who know me will be familiar with my tales of teaching
English overseas. My first experience was in Nepal.
</p>

<p>
Those of you may also remember me talking about my funny friend,
Kalu. He is the source of most of the mischief and entertaining
stories I have from my time in Nepal, and he remains one of the
greatest friends of my life.
</p>

<p>
I still have my journal from my time in Nepal, so I can say with
certainty that I first met Kalu on July 31, 2009. Kalu sold tourists
over-priced trinkets on the side of a road called Tridevi Sedak in
Thamel.
</p>

<p>
I know exactly what you're thinking, but no &#x2013; Kalu was a most unusual
street merchant. Tourism was down in Kathmandu at the time, and even
so, my first impression of him was that of generosity (perhaps a bad
trait for a merchant). A willingness to drop the hustle and just be
friends.
</p>

<p>
His first appearance in my journal:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I ended up talking with (Kalu) a great deal. I told him why I was in
Nepal and he cut the prices for me, although I certainly still
overpaid (but, to be honest, I don't particularly care), and he was
extremely nice with me. I asked him about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newar_people">Newari</a> culture and food, and
if there was a good Newari restaurant around; he promised to show me
if I came back, as I wanted to go back to Gatthaghar. He walked me all
the way to the bus, bought me a coke, and even tried to pay for a taxi
&#x2013; but I refused.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kalu had a wife and two sons. They lived near Asan in Kathmandu, in a
single room in an ancient building without electricity or running
water. But they had food, a place to sleep, and their kids were always
smiling. Kalu was Newari, an ethnic group of the Kathmandu valley. His
wife was not &#x2013; she was of another ethnicity, and they always amused
me by emphasizing that their marriage was not arranged. They eloped,
against their parents wishes, into what Nepali people would call a
"love marriage."
</p>

<p>
I took the significance they gave this to mean that their marriage was
a strong statement of love. In a culture where most relationships are
arranged, Kalu was in a minority that defied cultural and social
expectations. Not only that, but they had defied racial and caste
boundaries.
</p>

<p>
Suffice it to say, I don't think normal expectations of culture matter
much to Kalu. Maybe this is why he was so willing to be my friend.
</p>

<p>
I was an enthusiastic and curious 22 year old, and this was the first
significant time I had spent outside of the United States. Between my
teaching duties, I would regularly allow Kalu to drag me around
Kathmandu. He showed me the side of Kathmandu that only a local can
see.
</p>

<p>
In my journal, I spend a great deal of time describing the various
kinds of Newari cuisines, alcoholic beverages, and girls &#x2013; I was 22
years old, after all &#x2013; and our jovial times at a local cafe, owned by
a Newar man named Dinesh. I vividly remember Dinesh, who was a dwarf,
standing on the table with a broom stick, trying to change the TV
channel and yelling at us for being rowdy.
</p>

<p>
We became a trio with Kalu's nephew, Sanjay. Sanjay was closer to my
age and a butcher. I have descriptions of festivals we attended,
conversations we had (and are too inappropriate to repeat), and
more. I treasure this journal and my time in Nepal.
</p>

<p>
And to alleviate your concerns &#x2013; we were behaved. Even in retrospect,
I can affirm that we simply had good fun. There was no belligerent
intoxication, no blackouts &#x2013; nothing like that. I summarized this
time in my journal, after a night at Dinesh's cafe:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I have repeated this adventure a few more times with Kalu and
Sanjay. They are great friends.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This time with Kalu and Sanjay that summer taught me many lessons in
life that I have trouble committing to language.
</p>

<p>
Kalu never asked me for money. He lived in relative poverty with his
wife and two children, but he has never asked for money. In fact, as a
way to occupy him, I asked him to find authentic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thangka#Nepal">thangkas</a> for me to
purchase and bring back to the US, for which I gave him a
commission. I trusted him to find genuine thangkas and not
forgeries. However, in total, he could not have accumulated more than
$200 from me. It was not a substantial amount of money considering the
time we were together, and he frequently had to suspend our adventures
for a day or two in order to work and make money. He wouldn't take my
money. I think most people in Kalu's position would have taken
advantage of me. He did not.
</p>

<p>
Kalu wanted dignity. He didn't want charity, he wanted to feel useful
and that he had purpose. He knew we were equals, despite relative
cultural and economic disparities. One day, we were deep in
conversation and to make his point, he slapped my arm and told me,
"Our skin is different color, but we have the same blood." We do.
</p>

<p>
We spent enough time together that Nepal started to feel normal. What
people who spend a substantial time overseas, especially in a
non-western culture, don't often convey enough: the culture shock is
not leaving, it's coming back. Freshly back in the United States, I
can remember standing in the cereal aisle in the grocery store and had
a panic attack, overwhelmed by the gratuitous variety and wasteful
abundance. It not only felt alien, but somewhat vulgar.
</p>

<p>
I quite hilariously summarized this feeling in my journal:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Being back in Bellingham felt weird. Empty, even. It's difficult to
describe. I still feel out of place, and I'm not sure if this feeling
will ever go away. In a sense, I hope it doesn't&#x2026; Things hadn't
really changed, except they had.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is not an exaggeration to say that Kalu really became my best
friend during this time, maybe the best friend I will ever have in my
life. Following Kalu's defiance of cultural norms, cultural and
economic boundaries really do not matter when making connections with
other people. Kalu is really like my brother. I had been in Nepal
quite a long time before I met him, and I have not many anyone like
him, before or since.
</p>

<p>
I remember the sense of dread as my time in Nepal was coming to an
end. It lingered for weeks before hand, the sad realization that this
all must come to and end lurked just out of sight. We all knew it was
there but didn't have the heart to point it out.
</p>

<p>
I spent my last day in Nepal with Kalu and Sanjay. Kalu begged me to
come back the next year to see him again, and make it a regular
occurance. I knew, though, as a student, this would be extremely
difficult. Still, I made half-hearted promises, perhaps more to
myself. Knowing that I likely wouldn't have money to return the next
year, but after I began working &#x2013; that shouldn't be too long, right?
</p>

<p>
I left Nepal on September 15, 2009. This is the entry describing the
time I left Kalu for the final time:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Kalu found a small bus at Ratnapark for me to get on. It would be
faster than a regular bus. And, I must say, that saying goodbye to
Kalu and watching him walk away and disappear into the ocean of people
in the crowded bus depot nearly brought tears to my eyes &#x2013; this
friend was going back to his life, and I back to mine; and the utter
disparity between our lives washed over me. I was sad.
</p>

<p>
The drive back&#x2026; was bitter. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I learned this week that this was the last time I will ever see Kalu.
</p>

<p>
Kalu passed away last month, Feburary 2024, over 14 years since I last
saw him in person.
</p>

<p>
I always promised to return to Nepal, but I never made it. I'm
devastated now.
</p>

<p>
The excuses were easy: I could not get time off work, or I could not
find someone to watch my dogs. But now Kalu is gone. The plans we had
to reunite &#x2013; Kalu, Sanjay, and me &#x2013; to relive that summer in 2009,
when life felt so good &#x2013; well, those will never happen now.
</p>

<p>
I will regret and hate myself for the rest of my life for allowing
time to pass by.
</p>

<p>
It should not take the death of a friend to remind you of the most
sobering, inescapable fact of life: that time is the most scarce
resource of all. Kalu showed me that the brutality and inequity of the
world could be endured with dignity and humor, that divisions of race,
culture, economics, and religion are unimportant to making human
connection. That, if you have a loving family, children will smile
even when they have materially little, because relationships are a
currency that transcends material comforts.
</p>

<p>
When my own life is spent, I will not be on my death bed wishing that
I had spent those nights late at the office, my constant excuse for
not going. I will have wished to have had another summer in Nepal with
Kalu and Sanjay; or with my wife and kids; with my mother and
father. I always knew that intellectually, but now I feel it.
</p>

<p>
Don't be like me. The people in your life are all that matter.
</p>

<p>
There is a more subtle lesson, too &#x2013; for those looking closely, from
my time meeting Kalu to the time I departed was only about a month and
a half. That's it. That's all the time it takes to build a friendship
that changes your life.
</p>

<p>
The last entry in my journal reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This trip has irrecoverably changed the way I look at the human
condition, both as a whole and as it is expressed through my tiny
existence; and for that I am grateful, wiser, and most of all,
humbled.
</p>

<p>
18 September 2009 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thank you, Kalu. Until we meet again.
