<h2 id="org1d7c2b8">the proverbial chip-8 project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1d7c2b8">
<p>
The CHIP-8 is popular beginner project, and one I enjoy simply for the
purpose of learning (or re-learning) a programming language.
</p>

<p>
The CHIP-8 itself is a virtual machine and interpreter for an
instruction set. It's been ported to basically everything (including a
SNES cartridge, which I find hilarious), and was a popular hobbyist
development machine in the 70's and 80's.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, you would type in the instruction's hex codes using the
keypad and execute the program. Many CHIP-8 enthusiasts will tell you
how they'd work out the assembly on paper before manually entering the
instructions on the keypad.
</p>

<p>
There are a few reasons a CHIP-8 emulator is a good project is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You will use a fairly good cross-section of commonly used things in
any language: arrays, hash maps, iteration, conditionals, bitewise
operations, types or structs, and so on</li>

<li>Although the instruction set is easy, it can be insidiously
difficult to debug, and learning to debug effectively in a language
is a important skill you won't get from following tutorials</li>

<li>You will do some "non-tutorial" level tasks, like file IO, reading
bytes and decoding them into CHIP-8 instructions, maintaining the
emulator loop, drawing sprites to the screen, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That all being said, this is my experience writing a CHIP-8 emulator
in OCaml and Common Lisp.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf19c29f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf19c29f">OCaml</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf19c29f">
<p>
OCaml is a beautiful language, and writing it is almost like writing
math on a blackboard, which is a positive notion to a former
mathematics major. I've been thoroughly indoctrinated to the "make
invalid state unrepresentable" philosophy from my years as a Scala
developer, so OCaml felt like an incredibly simplified version of
Scala, with paradoxically a more powerful type system.
</p>

<p>
The CHIP-8 CPU contains various things, including the RAM, registers,
and a few "pseudo-registers", which include a program counter and so
on.
</p>

<p>
In OCaml, you might model that as such:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ocaml language-ocaml"><code>
(* in cpu.ml *)
type t = {
     memory : Memory.t;
     registers : Registers.t;
     mutable pc : uint16;
     (* ... *)
  }

(* in memory.ml *)
type t = bytes

let create () = Bytes.create 4096

(* in registers.ml *)

type t = uin8 array

let create () = Array.make 16 Uint8.zero

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
In OCaml, you can hide the concrete type by not exposing them directly
in the interface file. This hides the fact that, for example, the
memory is really just a byte array, and it allows you to provide safer
functions to operator on the type. For example, we might provide a
safer way to read uint8 values from the byte array.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ocaml language-ocaml"><code>(* memory.mli *)

(* leaving the type undefined here will "hide" the fact that it's
   really a byte array. We will refer to this type as Memory.t *)

type t

val read_uint8 : t -&gt; int -&gt; uint8 option

(* other function signatures *)

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
In this example, we might provide a read<sub>uint8</sub> function that allows a
user to read data from the CHIP-8 memory, but protects them if they
try to go over the 4kb limit. We disallow out of bounds exceptions by
returning an option, and because the underlying type is hidden, users
of our API can't subvert us by using standard byte array functions on
memory. The only API they get is the one we provide.
</p>

<p>
This is nice because it allows us to enforce safety. It's not quite as
good as refined types (see Scala, LiquidHaskell), but it still gets us
pretty far. I also found myself not minding the explicitness of making
my own interface files and hiding the implementation behind the
interface, because there was nothing hidden.
</p>

<p>
OCaml supports tagged unions, so one of the natural things to do is
make a type for the instruction set. This seems natural, because
building types for the instructions and functions to mutate the CPU on
those types (rather than raw unsigned 8-bit integers), decouples the
program logic from the raw data and allows us to take advantage of
OCaml's exhaustive pattern matching to more safely structure our
code. Any exceptions then are pushed to the edge when we translate the
raw uint8's into our intermediate data model of the instruction set.
</p>

<p>
This is what I did in OCaml, but is it a good idea? Going from:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>raw-data -&gt; intermediate types -&gt; cpu-effecting-functions</li>
</ul>

<p>
As opposed to this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>raw-data -&gt; cpu-effecting-functions</li>
</ul>

<p>
I went the first approach with OCaml, and this introduces an extra
step that is, strictly speaking, unnecessary. It has a few advantages,
for instance, if we wanted to decompile ROMs to their human-readable
instructions, we could re-use those intermediate types. We could also
use the intermediate types to write our own assembler to make our own
CHIP-8 programs.
</p>

<p>
But it's interesting how the language design &#x2013; at least for me &#x2013;
pushed me to this direction. I wanted to use OCaml's exhaustive
pattern matching, so I intuitively began modeling the instruction set
separate from the raw data model. In C and Zig, I did not do
this. Perhaps going straight from raw data to operating on the CHIP-8
CPU is more "data-oriented"?
</p>

<p>
Tagged unions of instructions and exploiting exhaustive pattern
matching might look something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ocaml language-ocaml"><code>type instruction = CLR | RET | JP_Addr of uint8 (* and more ... *)

let execute_instruction cpu inst =
  match inst with 
  | CLR -&gt; (* ... *)
  | RET -&gt; (* ... *)
  | JP_Addr nnn -&gt; (* ... *)

let tick cpu =
  (* get the next opcode at the program counter *)
  let opcode = Memory.get cpu.pc in
  (* execute the instruction *)
  execute_instruction cpu opcode

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Taken together, these features allow you to effectively restrict the
domain of possible input values and, yes, make invalid state
unrepresentable.
</p>

<p>
How was the experience developing with OCaml? Frankly, I was surprised
how good it was. The tooling with Emacs is very good. The OCaml
community seem to complain about tooling, and while it may be somewhat
bare bones, it was at least stable (for me).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7b44c63" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7b44c63">Common Lisp</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7b44c63">
<p>
Common Lisp is quite different than OCaml and it was a surprising
experience.
</p>

<p>
One of the things I enjoy about Common Lisp is the Common Lisp Object
System (CLOS). This is not a conventional object-oriented system, it
is, briefly, something more akin to "enhanced" structs with
multimethods, and some devious ways of customizing the method dispatch
(known as the metaobject protocol).
</p>

<p>
And by "enhanced structs" I mean that CLOS classes are essentially
data containers &#x2013; they only contain data and do not co-locate methods
and data together &#x2013; but the field members (known as slots) have
several capabilities beyond raw data containers, such as the ability
to enforce type.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-lisp language-lisp"><code>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">defclass</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">instruction</span> () ())

(<span style="font-weight: bold;">defgeneric</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">execute-instruction</span> (cpu instruction))
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-lisp language-lisp"><code>(definstruction jp-addr nnn)

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">;; </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">instruction  here (example)</span>
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">defmethod</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">execute-instruction</span> ((cpu cpu) (opcode jp-addr))

    (<span style="font-weight: bold;">with-slots</span> (nnn) opcode
      (setf pc nnn))))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
What is this "definstruction" in the above example? This is one of the
strengths of Common Lisp &#x2013; you can simply create new syntax to reduce
boilerplate.
</p>

<p>
This is the definition of definstruction.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-lisp language-lisp"><code>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">defmacro</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">definstruction</span> (name <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">&amp;rest</span> fields)
  `(<span style="font-weight: bold;">progn</span>
     (<span style="font-weight: bold;">defclass</span> ,name (instruction)
       ,(<span style="font-weight: bold;">loop</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">:for</span> field <span style="font-weight: bold;">:in</span> fields

                         <span style="font-weight: bold;">:initarg</span> ,(intern (symbol-name field) <span style="font-style: italic;">"KEYWORD"</span>)
                         <span style="font-weight: bold;">:reader</span> ,(intern (concatenate 'string
                                                       (symbol-name name) <span style="font-style: italic;">"-"</span>
                                                       (symbol-name field))))))
     (<span style="font-weight: bold;">defmethod</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">print-object</span> ((obj ,name) out)
       (print-unreadable-object (obj out <span style="font-weight: bold;">:type</span> t <span style="font-weight: bold;">:identity</span> t)
         (<span style="font-weight: bold;">dolist</span> (slot ',fields)
           (format out <span style="font-style: italic;">"~A: ~X "</span>
                   (string slot)
                   (slot-value obj slot)))))))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Then the call to definstruction above expands to this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-lisp language-lisp"><code>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">progn</span>
 (<span style="font-weight: bold;">defclass</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">jp-addr</span> (instruction) ((nnn <span style="font-weight: bold;">:initarg</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">:nnn</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">:reader</span> jp-addr-nnn)))
 (<span style="font-weight: bold;">defmethod</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">print-object</span> ((obj jp-addr) out)
   (print-unreadable-object (obj out <span style="font-weight: bold;">:type</span> t <span style="font-weight: bold;">:identity</span> t)
     (<span style="font-weight: bold;">dolist</span> (slot '(nnn))
       (format out <span style="font-style: italic;">"~A: ~X "</span> (string slot) (slot-value obj slot))))))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
This executes a procedure that
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Creates a jp-addr class, subclassed by instruction with
auto-generated slots.</li>
<li>Creates a print-object method (think of toString).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Although it may seem a bit silly, this substantially reduces
boilerplate &#x2013; and reducing boilerplate in intelligent ways can make
programs more understandable by humans and less prone to bugs.
</p>

<p>
Another strength is that Common Lisp is unquestionably the most
debugable language I've ever used. The REPL is renowned because it
allows you to recompile the project at runtime, but the real hero in
my project was the condition system. Any error gets captured top-level
and you're given the chance to fix the source code, recompile the code
that caused the error, and retry without exiting the program.
</p>

<p>
I can't tell you how many times I screwed up a CHIP-8 instruction and
overflowed the register. When running in Sly (the REPL in Emacs), I'd
hit the faulty instruction and Sly would capture the condition and
pause the emulator. I could then go fix the instruction, recompile the
definition, and tell Sly to retry the instruction. It would work
without having to reset the entire emulator! I was able to work
through most of the emulator in this fashion, not even implementing
most of the instructions, and just implementing them as I hit them one
by one.
</p>

<p>
So that was basically the development experience, and it was an
interesting one: stub out instructions without fully implementing
them, run the emulator and when you the interpreter ran into an
unimplemented instruction, it would capture the condition and allow
you to inspect implement the instruction, inspect the emulators RAM &#x2013;
everything. It was an interesting experience having the full REPL and
the ability to capture conditions to pause and resume like that.

<h2 id="org6114053">Zig? Racket? D?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6114053">
<p>
When writing this, I was working on a Zig implementation. It is not
finished, mostly due to time and life commitments. I won't comment
much, but the experience so far has been incredibly positive.
</p>

<p>
I've used D on and off for years, and even written a small game in
it. I love the opt-out GC, and the future opt-in borrow checker sounds
extremely compelling. D has recently added ImportC, which may give the
same ergonomics as Zig when interoperating with C libraries.
</p>

<p>
I'm also curious about Racket. I have a long albeit casual history
writing Racket, and my memory is that it's considerably more
consistent and less crufty than Common Lisp, has a superior macro
system, although doesn't have the same debugability superpowers. I'm
curious to see what modern Racket feels like. I have visions of using
the #lang features in Racket to build a high-level CHIP-8 assembler.
</p>

<p>
I would like to do this in the future, but for now I'm a bit tired of
making CHIP-8 emulators. I'll follow up this post if I ever get to
it.

<p>
I will continue using OCaml and Common Lisp. It's hard for me to pick
a favorite.
</p>

<p>
OCaml vs. Common Lisp was an interesting contrast, and made me
re-evaluate some long-held opinions on testing, soundness, and type
safety. Again, I've worked with Scala professionally for so long, what
I "got" from OCaml was what I expected (in a good way). But I can't
deny that, although in many ways I'd consider OCaml to be the superior
language, the tooling and debugability of Common Lisp made me
shockingly productive. This brings up an interesting thought
experiment to consider: What is more important? Type safety or
debugability?
</p>

<p>
I think OCaml would be great for anything where safety, specification,
and low tolerance for bugs are a priority. The code is also, in my
opinion, the most readable of the bunch. It has high performance and
is easy to write. It would be great for writing tooling &#x2013; say, for
example, you wanted to write a DSL and a build system to deploy
clustered Erlang applications. This would be challenging because
Erlang applications, when they run in a clustered way, need to be
configured consistently across the cluster, and such a system would
need a level of static analysis to determine the correctness of the
configuration. OCaml would be great for this.
</p>

<p>
Common Lisp would be great for anything exploratory, where you are
unsure what the project will turn into and look like by the time you
are done with it, and for something that needed hardcore debugging,
especially if it ran in a loop or was otherwise difficult for
traditional languages and tooling to debug. I actually think Common
Lisp would be great for things like game development, web servers, and
GUI applications. Such applications are amenable to being built in a
malleable way, leveraging the interactivity of Common Lisp.
</p>

<p>
Either way, both are awesome languages and I'm happy to work with
both.
