#+TITLE: about

I'm a software developer living in Minnesota with a background in
distributed sytems and functional programming. I work at [[https://www.47deg.com][47 Degrees]]
helping companies write high-performance, safe, scalable software.

My professional experience has mostly been in the Scala ecosystem,
including Akka, Typelevel/Cats Effect, and ZIO. I also enjoy (in no
particular order) Haskell, Clojure, Racket, Elixir, and other
technologies I may sometimes write about.
